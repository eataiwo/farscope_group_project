3. Generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for your GitHub account and [enter it to your local git install in Ubuntu](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git) 
4. Clone the Git repo from here 

# Making changes 

1. Create a new local branch to make related changes 
2. Push local branch to remote 
3. When work on the branch is complete, open a pull request to merge the remote branch with main, which I (James) will review before merging 
4. Don't try to commit directly to remote main (it won't work)
